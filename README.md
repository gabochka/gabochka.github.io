# gabby's website

hi gabby

remember, the `html` file is for the structure/content of your website, while the `css` file is for stylizing it.

you can search `w3chools how to do blablabla in css` to find some documentation and tutorials

good luck!

*(p.s. this is the README file, you can edit it to change what text appears here. it's written in `Markdown`, which is a very simple markup language. `html` is also a markup language, albeit a more complex one.)*
